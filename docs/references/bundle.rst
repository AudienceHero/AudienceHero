Bundle directory structure
==========================

A Bundle created as an extension for AudienceHero should follow the same directory structure as described below:


- Tests should be located in ``Tests/``.
- Asynchronous related code should go to ``Queue/``.
- Fixtures should go to ``Resources/fixtures/orm``.
- Javascript modules should be located in ``Resources/modules``
