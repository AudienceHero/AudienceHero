What is AudienceHero?
=====================

AudienceHero is a modular API-Centric Audience Management System.
AudienceHero is a free (as in speech, and as in beer) software licensed under the Affero General Public License.

Wait! What?
-----------

It is still complex or expensive to create a basic online presence on the web, for non tech savvy people.
AudienceHero aims to answer that problem by providing an all-in-one tool to:

- Have an online presence
- Have a newsletter
- Manage media
- Capture email addresses
- Organize their communication through different channels
- Provide detailed stats about their audience

Think of what can do a well configured wordpress with already installed plug-ins, and you will get what the
aim of the project is.
